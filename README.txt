Analysis of 2011 Scottish Census

This project analyses `Scotland_teaching_file_1PCT.csv` (in the `data` subdirectory),
a dataset containing a 1% sample of the 2011 Scottish census. All basic requirements
are met, along with all but one of the additional requirements (interactive control
of the plots).

The main file is notebooks/notebook.ipynb, which is a Jupyter notebook file which,
when run, provides analysis of the dataset. This notebook uses the python files in
the code subdirectory, and reads information from the data subdirectory.
